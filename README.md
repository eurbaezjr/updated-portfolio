# Eduardo Urbaez's React Portfolio

My portfolio was built using React. 

## Building Blocks

* Application built using React

* A `Nav` component that appears on multiple pages

* Separating skills into `Components`for modularization 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories

* Resume and Linkedin links

## Instructions

  - [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
    - [Design](#design)
  - [React](#react)
  - [Updated LinkedIn Profile](#updated-linkedin-profile)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. You may we

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages


### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Make sure to update your LinkedIn Profile with the new skills you've acquired since the last time it was updated.
